# Mopidy setup notes

## mopidy-json-client
[mopidy-json-client](https://github.com/ismailof/mopidy-json-client) though not very active looks like a good library to talk
with mopidy on local from Python. Tried
```sh
pi@rpi:~ $ pip3 install https://github.com/ismailof/mopidy-json-client/archive/master.zip
```
Seemed to work.
